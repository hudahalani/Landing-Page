									Circuit Building</h1>
									<p>As part of the course Electrical Fields and Circuits, we were paired up and built a series of circuits.</p>

                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/coil.jpg" alt="" /></span> During second semester of first year, I participated in various hands-on labs that enhanced my practical understanding of electrical and computer engineering principles.  We tested and calculated currents, voltages, and resistances, becoming familiar with DMM machines and proto-boards. Through these experiences, I developed strong technical skills in using lab equipment and software tools, reinforced my theoretical knowledge, and gained valuable problem-solving abilities. Displayed are images of our labs and the circuits we built.

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/92207.jpg" alt="" /></span> During second year, I learned to analyze linear electrical circuits using Kirchhoff’s laws, Thevenin/Norton equivalents,
								and AC steady-state analysis. The course introduced tools like phasors, frequency response, and complex impedance, which are essential for
								understanding filters and power systems. Labs with LTSpice simulations and hands-on circuit building helped reinforce
								the
								theory and improve my debugging skills. I also took ECE231 which introduced key electronic components like diodes, BJTs, and
								MOSFETs, focusing on their operation and use in
								amplifier circuits. I learned about DC biasing, small-signal models, and the design of common-emitter/source amplifiers.
								The course emphasized real-world behavior, and labs helped me understand how analog systems handle trade-offs like gain,
								bandwidth, and distortion.
