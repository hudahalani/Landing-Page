                                    I joined the club 'Your Next Career Network,' which is UofT's largest student run career network.
                
                                    Every year YNCN helps 6,000+ students connect with 100+ employers. As a part of the operations and logistics team, I was in charge of running two events during second year, as well as aiding in running the Fall & Winter Career Fairs. 
                                    Our team recently went on a weekend retreat to Blue Mountain to promote teamwork and build stronger connections. The trip was incredible, offering both relaxation and the perfect setting to bond with colleagues. I had the chance to engage in meaningful conversations, share experiences, and learn more about my teammates on a personal level. 
                                    The retreat not only strengthened our collaboration but also created lasting memories that will enhance our teamwork moving forward. <hr />
                                
                                    
                                    <header class="major"> </header>
                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/swimming.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
                                       Over the summer I took swimming lessons. This was quite the shocker to everyone (including myself - I didn't even remember signing up) because as a kid when I took classes I failed Ultra 3 (a basic/simple level) several times which led me to not swim again for years. 
                                       I did attempt it a few times throughout my teenage years but I could never swim that well, so despite it being a beginner level I was still dreading the first class so much.
                                    However, I was determined to still do it and pushed myself out of my comfort zone, and throughout my classes I realized that I actually like swimming, and that I wasn't as bad as I thought.
                                        While you definitely won't be seeing me in the Olympics anytime soon, I do enjoy it and want to continue swimming consistently. 
                                        
                                        <hr/>
                                        <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/taekwondo.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
                                           I did Taekwondo with my sister for a few years, and became a black belt. I stopped when I started University because my classes ended late and I couldn't reach home in time for taekwondo. 
                                           I loved going because my teachers were really caring and nice, I became friends with my peers (even though some of them were like 8 years old), it kept me active, and made me realize if I push myself I can accomplish anything (~3.5 pushups) kidding LOL.
                                         Being able to spar and kick my sister without getting in-trouble was also an added bonus (kidding).
                                        
                                        <br/><hr/>
                                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/frosh.JPG" alt="" /></span> 
                                            Throughout the years I've volunteered at numerous events, charity organizations, races, and mosques. Most recently I volunteered at Pre-Frosh which is orientation for the incoming engineers. 
                                            I was thrilled to volunteer and meet UofT's newest victims (kidding) and the cute free pink T-shirts we got were an added bonus ðŸ˜‰.
                                             I love volunteering because it's not only helping others but I usually do it with friends/family and it makes for a memorable experience (and matching T-shirts).

											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/arabic.webp" alt="" /></span>
											Outside of academics, I'm currently learning Arabic through the Bayyinah Institute. This self-paced program helps me
											deepen my understanding of the language, with a focus on grammar, vocabulary, and Quranic comprehension. Arabic used to
											seem overwhelmingly difficult; understanding it felt impossible at first. But once I actually put the effort to learn, I discovered how
											fascinating the grammar is, it's a fulfilling way to challenge myself
											intellectually and connect more with my faith. I recommend everyone to try learning as well!

											I also spent a season as a soccer coach for kids aged 10â€“12 at the Islamic Soccer League, which was one of the most
											rewarding leadership experiences Iâ€™ve had. Our team won most of our games, not just because of skill, but because of the
											teamwork, discipline, and perseverance the players developed together. Coaching taught me how to motivate others, adapt
											to different learning styles, and create a fun, supportive environment where everyone could grow and succeed. In the image you
											can see a picture of one of the students I coached - he ended up becoming quite a decent player thanks to my help!
