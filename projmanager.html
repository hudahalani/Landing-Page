									<h1><br />
									Project Manager</h1>
									<p>As part of the engineering curriculum at University of Toronto, we were placed into teams of 5 and tasked with creating innovate solutions to real world problems.</p>

								<p>As a member of a collaborative team of engineers, we worked on a project focused on addressing accessibility challenges within a UofT building. As project manager, I meticulously oversaw all aspects of the project, from setting and tracking deadlines to ensuring seamless coordination among team members. By leveraging effective communication and organizational skills, I facilitated a cohesive team dynamic, ensuring everyone remained on track and aligned with project objectives.

Through this project I honed my teamwork, responsibility, organization, and leadership skills. In addition, I became familiar with AutoCAD (shown above) and how to communicate my ideas professionally.
