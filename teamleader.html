									<p>Engineering Strategies and Practices II</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/leader.jpg" alt="Team Leadership Project" /></div>
								
								<h2>Project Overview</h2>
								<p>As part of the Engineering Strategies and Practices II course, I led a team of seven engineers in developing a solution to a real-world environmental problem: pollution caused by steel-corroding parking blocks. This project required innovative thinking, effective team management, and close collaboration with a client to deliver a practical, environmentally-friendly solution.</p>

								<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
								<p>The client presented a significant environmental challenge: traditional steel parking blocks were corroding over time, releasing harmful pollutants into the environment. Our team was tasked with designing an alternative solution that would:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Eliminate Corrosion:</strong> Prevent the release of harmful steel corrosion products</li>
									<li><strong>Maintain Functionality:</strong> Preserve the safety and effectiveness of parking blocks</li>
									<li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Provide a viable economic alternative to existing solutions</li>
									<li><strong>Environmentally Sustainable:</strong> Reduce environmental impact throughout the product lifecycle</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Leadership Role</h2>
								
								<h3>Team Management</h3>
								<p>As the team leader, I was responsible for coordinating a diverse group of seven engineers:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Project Coordination:</strong> Ensured all project guidelines were strictly followed and deadlines consistently met</li>
									<li><strong>Communication Facilitation:</strong> Fostered effective communication and cooperation among team members</li>
									<li><strong>Task Distribution:</strong> Assigned roles and responsibilities based on individual strengths and expertise</li>
									<li><strong>Progress Monitoring:</strong> Tracked project milestones and ensured timely delivery of deliverables</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Client Relations</h3>
								<p>Maintained strong relationships with the client throughout the project lifecycle:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Regular Communication:</strong> Scheduled and conducted regular meetings with the client</li>
									<li><strong>Requirement Gathering:</strong> Collected and documented client specifications and constraints</li>
									<li><strong>Progress Updates:</strong> Provided regular updates on project development and milestones</li>
									<li><strong>Final Presentation:</strong> Led the team presentation that thoroughly impressed the client</li>
								</ul>
